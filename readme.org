* Config files

** [[./modprobe.d/blacklist.conf]]

Turns off the pcspkr module to stop annoying beeps in tty.

** [[./environment]]

Sets XDG_*_HOME vars so config is placed in the right place.

** [[./gamemode.ini]]

Gamemode is a set of optimisations to speed up games.
This is my config to speed it up as much as possible.

** [[./mkinitcpio.conf]]

Part of the startup process, controlling which kernel modules are loaded.

** [[./pacman.conf]]

While I use yup as the package manager, the pacman output is still visible from
it, so I make it look as good as possible. This also enables the multilib repos
for steam, and parallel download for faster installs.
